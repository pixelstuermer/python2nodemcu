The web is full of tutorials and documentation on how to develop Lua or C++ scripts for https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware[ESP microcontrollers] (and boards building on it) and flashing them with the https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE].
But when turning away from this out-of-the-box toolset, the support is getting sparse but still available.

So things get a bit trickier when replacing the language with Python and avoiding the Arduino IDE.
IMHO, support and documentation is indeed still available but not as satisfying as expected.
I somehow found it puzzling that developing and uploading Python scripts for those controllers seems not to be that famous or at least not so well documented.

While researching and trying different things I consulted several resources because none of them was, what I would call, an end-to-end documentation.
This document therefore tries to summarize and provide the lessons I've learned from it.
Please see the following table of contents to get insights of the structure and subjects.
Please also note that it is based on MacOS Sierra and the https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html[NodeMcu board].
